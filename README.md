# blog

A personal tool to create html blogposts from Pandoc markdown files. Kinda 
hardcoded because, again, it's just a personal tool.

## Usage

Requires all markdown files to be in a directory inside the current 
directory. The table of contents will be made in the current directory.

```bash
bundle install
ruby blog.rb path/
```
